# Spring DSL

This project is an attempt to build on the concepts pioneered by Sebastien Deleuze in Spring-fu, but with is a slightly different focust.

Spring DSL is designed to be able to be mixed-in to an existing Spring Boot project seamlessly.

Spring DSL is designed to be extensible, and is ideal for Platform engineers who are building internal runtime frameworks on top of Spring Boot.
